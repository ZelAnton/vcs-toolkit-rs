## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `GitApi` trait + `Git` client with typed, repo-scoped commands returning parsed
  structs: `status` (`StatusEntry`), `log`/`current_branch`/`branches`/`rev_parse`,
  `init`/`add`/`commit`, `diff_is_empty`. New `Commit`/`Branch`/`StatusEntry` types.
- **Mockable by design:** consumers code against `GitApi`; `Git::with_runner`
  injects a fake process runner (e.g. `processkit::ScriptedRunner`), and the
  `mock` feature generates `MockGitApi` (via `mockall`) for stubbing whole methods.
- `create_branch`, `checkout`, and raw `run`/`run_raw` escape hatches on `GitApi`.
- `Commit` gained `short_hash` and `date` (ISO-8601 `%aI`).
- `Git::default_timeout` kills any command exceeding the deadline.

### Changed
- The API is now the `Git` client + `GitApi` trait — the original free functions
  (`run`/`version`/`status`/…) are gone. Commands launch `git` inside an OS job
  (Windows Job Object / Linux cgroup v2) via `processkit`, killed on close.
- **Now async (tokio):** every `GitApi` method is `async`. Errors are the typed
  `processkit::Error` (exit code, stderr, …) instead of `io::Error`.
  Adds `async-trait`.
- `status` now runs `git status --porcelain=v1 -z` (NUL-delimited records, raw
  unescaped paths — robust to spaces and special characters) and `log` uses `-z`
  record separation (robust to multi-line fields). `StatusEntry` gained
  `orig_path`, the source path for a rename/copy (`R`/`C`).
- Built on the external **`processkit`** crate (the `CliClient` core, the
  `cli_client!` macro, the `ProcessRunner` seam, and the structured `Error`) —
  replacing the prototype internal `vcs-process` crate. No public API change
  beyond `run_raw` now returning `processkit::ProcessResult<String>`.
- `StatusEntry`/`Commit`/`Branch` are now `#[non_exhaustive]` — future fields
  won't be breaking changes.
- Optional `tracing` feature (forwards to `processkit/tracing`): a `debug` event
  per `git` command.

### Fixed
- `status`/`branches` parsing no longer corrupts the first entry: output is parsed
  raw instead of being trimmed, which had stripped leading `--porcelain` status
  spaces and `branch` markers.
