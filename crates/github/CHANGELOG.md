This crate is versioned and published independently of the other workspace
crates; tag releases as `vcs-github-v<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
-

### Changed
- Bumped `processkit` to 0.4 — macOS/BSD process trees are now contained via a
  POSIX process group (`killpg` on drop) instead of an uncontained spawn.

### Fixed
-

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- feat(process): job-backed spawn (JobObject/cgroup) + publish setup
- feat: typed command wrappers, exec options, integration tests
- feat: mockable trait-based API + Runner injection
- feat: async (tokio) API, timeouts, structured errors, richer models
- feat: non_exhaustive result structs, optional tracing, cli_client! macro


### Changed

- Scaffold vcs-toolkit-rs workspace from rust-repo-template
- review: harden whole solution, fix potential issues
- refactor: portable Output model, CliClient core, richer test seam, -z git parsing
- refactor: replace internal vcs-process with external processkit 0.3
- ci: release workflow picks major/minor/patch with auto-increment (+ all-crates, first-release)
- Release: vcs-git v0.1.0, vcs-jj v0.1.0, vcs-github v0.1.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `GitHubApi` trait + `GitHub` client with typed commands deserializing
  `gh … --json` into structs: `pr_list`/`pr_view` (`PullRequest`), `issue_list`
  (`Issue`), `repo_view` (`Repo`), `auth_status`, and raw `api`. Adds
  `serde`/`serde_json`.
- **Mockable by design:** consumers code against `GitHubApi`; `GitHub::with_runner`
  injects a fake process runner, and the `mock` feature generates `MockGitHubApi`
  (via `mockall`).
- `pr_create` and raw `run`/`run_raw` on `GitHubApi`.
- `PullRequest` gained `base_ref_name` and `url`; `Repo` now has `owner`, `url`,
  `is_private`, and `default_branch`.
- `GitHub::default_timeout` kills any command exceeding the deadline.

### Changed
- The API is now the `GitHub` client + `GitHubApi` trait — the original free
  functions are gone. Commands launch `gh` inside an OS job (Windows Job Object /
  Linux cgroup v2) via `processkit`, killed on close.
- **Now async (tokio):** every `GitHubApi` method is `async`; errors are the typed
  `processkit::Error` (JSON parse failures become `Error::Parse`).
  Adds `async-trait`.
- Built on the external **`processkit`** crate (the `CliClient` core, the
  `cli_client!` macro, the `ProcessRunner` seam, and the structured `Error`) —
  replacing the prototype internal `vcs-process` crate. `run_raw` now returns
  `processkit::ProcessResult<String>`.
- `PullRequest`/`Issue`/`Repo` are now `#[non_exhaustive]` — future fields won't
  be breaking changes.
- Optional `tracing` feature (forwards to `processkit/tracing`): a `debug` event
  per `gh` command.

### Fixed
- `auth_status` no longer reports "not authenticated" when `gh auth status` times
  out — a timeout surfaces as `processkit::Error::Timeout` (via `CliClient::code`,
  backed by processkit 0.3's first-class timeout error).
