## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial release: the `processkit`-coupled plumbing the CLI wrappers share —
  `reject_flag_like` (the argv injection guard, parameterized by program name),
  the `FETCH_ATTEMPTS`/`FETCH_BACKOFF` fetch-retry policy, and the error
  classifiers `is_merge_conflict` / `is_nothing_to_commit` /
  `is_transient_fetch_error`. Extracted from the copies previously duplicated
  across `vcs-git` and `vcs-jj` so the transient-failure marker list and the
  classifiers can no longer drift between backends.

### Changed
- Bumped `processkit` to **0.8** — `Error` (taken by the classifiers) stays
  `#[non_exhaustive]`; an unfamiliar variant classifies as "no" on every
  classifier (covered by a test). Breaking for consumers matching
  `processkit::Error` exhaustively.
- New off-by-default **`cancellation`** feature (forwards to
  `processkit/cancellation`): the classifiers only match `Exit`/`Timeout`, so
  `Error::Cancelled` already falls through every one to "no"; the feature only lets
  a test construct the variant to pin that (not transient, not a conflict, not
  nothing-to-commit) as a first-class assertion.
- `reject_flag_like` also refuses whitespace-only values (as meaning-changing as
  empty ones), not just empty and leading-`-`.
